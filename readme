Our raw and processed data is available at: https://figshare.com/s/4f071118f2fde3f00a26
This is code used for paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.29.501997v1

#### These steps are optional, the data is already present in the FigShare directory ####
First, run get_somatic_variants.sh to obtain vcfs for each sample containing its unique snvs and indels
Then, run get_txt_files.sh to obtain txt files of these vcfs.
To filter the discrete set of snvs further, run filter_snvs.R. This creates new vcf files.
To filter the discrete set of indels further, run filter_indels.R. This creates new vcf files.
Run get_Zou_Kucab_indels.R to get vcfs for Zou and Kucab indels. 
Run get_Zou_Kucab.R to get snv counts for Zou and Kucab.
Run sigprofiler_snvmatrix.sh to generate matrices for SigProfilerExtractor.
To extract SNV and indel signatures with SigProfiler, run sigprofiler_cpu.sh.
To decompose these signatures, run sigprofiler_decompose.sh.

To analyse samples and generate plots, run SNV_ID_sample_plots.R.
To analyse the SNV signatures and generate plots, run SNVsig_plots.R. For indels, run IDsig_plots.R.

To perform randomizations of mutation burdens, SNV and indel signature activities, run randomizations.R and then randomizations_plots.R for plots.
To analyse structural variant calls from Manta run manta_analysis.R.
To analyse clustered SNVs, run analysis_clusters.R.

Beds and input mutation files for SNVs and SVs are provided in the FigShare directory.
